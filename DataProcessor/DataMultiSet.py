DataMultiSet is the collection of data sets.
The main purpuse of this class is to simplify the analysis of several DataSets

Fields specific for the DataMultiSet

processType     : DY or SIDIS. The sets should not mix. 
                the reason is that they are colled in parrallel, and thus
                it is better to keep them apart.
sets     : list of DataSet's included in the consideration
numberOfSets    : total number of sets in the multiSet
numberOfPoints  : total number of points in the multiSet
